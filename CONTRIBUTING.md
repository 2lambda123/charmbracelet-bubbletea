## Commit Message Guidelines

We have strict rules over how our **git commit messages** can be formatted. This
leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through
the **project history**.

01. Separate subject from body with a blank line
02. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
03. Capitalize the subject line
04. Do not end the subject line with a period
05. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
06. Wrap the body at 72 characters
07. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

### Revert and Merge

Use default GIT templates for `revert` and `merge`.

## Issues

Before creating a new issue, please search for similar issues, open or closed,
to see if someone else has already noticed the same problem and possible
solutions.

Do not comment on open issues unless you can provide more information to resolve
it. Use the subscribe function to keep up-to-date with the issue or the voting
system to support it.

## Bug reports

When you can't find a previous bug, open an issue keeping in mind the following
considerations:

- Try to reproduce the bug using the code found on the `main` branch
- Copy and paste the full error message, including the `backtrace`
- Be as detailed as possible and include any additional information

## Feature requests

If you want to request or implement a new feature please submit an issue
describing the details and possible use cases.

## Thanks
